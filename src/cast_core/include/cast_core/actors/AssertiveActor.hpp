/**
 * This actor asserts that the results of two aggregations (or any two valid database commands)
 * return equivalent results. This is primarily useful for validating the TPC-H workload queries.
 *
 * Note: One important caveat to consider is around numeric type comparison. Because aggregations
 * may result in small rounding errors, and in particular because doubles that are close to ints
 * may round and be converted to ints (as is the case in the TPC-H validation workload),
 * the AssertiveActor does not perform an exact comparison on ints. Instead, it considers any pair
 * of numbers (even if their types differ) as equal if they are close enough according to a hard-coded
 * limit in the actor.
 *

 * SchemaVersion: 2017-07-01
 * Actors:
 * - Name: AssertiveActor
 *   Type: AssertiveActor
 *   Phases:
 *   - Repeat: 1
 *     Database: test
 *     Message: coll1 documents with foo=1 are identical to coll2 documents
 *     Expected:
 *       aggregate: coll1
 *       pipeline: [{$match: {foo: 1}}, {$sort: {_id: 1}}]
 *       cursor: {batchSize: 101}
