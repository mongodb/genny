Description: >
  Runs a workload that deletes a large range of documents while performing writes on another collection.
  Allows for comparing the performance of the DELETE_STAGE vs the BATCHED_DELETE_STAGE, primarily in terms
  of deletion throughput, and w:majority latencies of the concurrent writes.
  The mass deletion namespace is test.Collection0
  The concurrent writes namespace is test.concurrentWritesColl
