Description: |
  With queryable encryption enabled, this workload runs alternating CRUD and compact phases,
  where the total number of inserts & updates is increased on every CRUD+Compact cycle in order
  to grow the ECOC collection to a size that is at least twice its pre-compaction size in
  the previous cycle. This is meant to test how long compaction takes relative to ECOC size.
  Parameters:
    Database:             name of encrypted database
    Collection:           name of encrypted collection
    ClientName:           name of encrypted client pool
    Namespace:            namespace of the encrypted collection

  # This actor runs the inserts and updates to increase the size of the ECOC collection before

  # previous phase, so that the ECOC size is also doubled.
