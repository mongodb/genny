Description: |
  Phase defintions for the MixedWorkloadsGenny, which is a port of the mixed_workloads in the
  workloads repo. https://github.com/10gen/workloads/blob/master/workloads/mix.js. It runs 4 sets of
  operations, each with dedicated actors/threads. The 4 operations are insertOne, findOne,
  updateOne, and deleteOne. Since each type of operation runs in a dedicated thread it enables
  interesting behavior, such as reads getting faster because of a write regression, or reads being
  starved by writes. The origin of the test was as a reproduction for BF-2385 in which reads were
  starved out by writes.
