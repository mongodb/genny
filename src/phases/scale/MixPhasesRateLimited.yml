Description: |
  Phase defintion for the MixedWorkloadsGennyRateLimited, which is a port of the mixed_workloads in the
  workloads repo. https://github.com/10gen/workloads/blob/master/workloads/mix.js. It runs 4 sets of
  operations, each with dedicated actors/threads. The 4 operations are insertOne, findOne,
  updateOne, and deleteOne. Previously, each type of operation ran in a dedicated thread which resulted in
  high CPU utilization of around 90% (this workload can be found in MixedWorkloadsGenny). 
  The Update operations was found to cause the highest CPU usage. Rate Limits were added to maintain CPU 
  utlization at 30-40%, along with using a higher thread level and decreasing phase number count from 4 to 1.
