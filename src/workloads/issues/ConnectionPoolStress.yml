Description: |
  This workload was created to reproduce issues discovered during sharded stress testing. The workload can cause
  low performance, spikes in latency and excessive connection creation (on mongos processes). The metrics to look at
  for this workload are the latencies and more specifically the Latency90thPercentile to Latency99thPercentile metrics.

  The workload performs the following steps:
    - Phase 0
      - Upsert a Single Document in the collection
      - set ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxSize
      - set ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMinSize
    - Phase 1
      - Execute a find command for GlobalConnectionDuration seconds in GlobalConnectionThreads threads.

Keywords:
- reproducer
- connections
- secondaryPreferred
- sharding
- latency

Parameters:
- ConnectionThreads: &GlobalConnectionThreads 8000
- ConnectionDuration: &GlobalConnectionDuration 600 seconds
- ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxSize: &GlobalShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxSize 32767  # Essentially a noop as this is the default.
- ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMinSize: &GlobalShardingTaskExecutorPoolMinSize     1  # Essentially a noop as this is the default.
- ReadMode: &GlobalReadMode secondaryPreferred
- MaxPoolSize: &GlobalMaxPoolSize 15000

- &MaxPhases 1
- Database: &Database test
- Collection: &Collection Collection0
