SchemaVersion: 2018-07-01
Owner: Product Performance
Description: |
  This workload was created to reproduce issues discovered during sharded stress testing. The workload can cause
  low performance, spikes in latency and excessive connection creation (on mongos processes).

  The main metrics to monitor are:
    * ErrorsTotal / ErrorRate: The total number of errors and rate of errors encountered by the workload. Networking
      errors are not unexpected in general and they should be recoverable. This work load strives to provide a test to
      allow us to measure the scale of networking errors in a stressful test and prove if the networking becomes more
      stable (with lower total errors and a lower error rate).
    * The Operation latency (more specifically the Latency90thPercentile to Latency99thPercentile metrics)
    * The Operation Throughput
    * "ss connections active": the number of connections.

  The workload performs the following steps:
    - Phase 0
      - Upsert a Single Document in the collection
      - set ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxSize
      - set ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMinSize
    - Phase 1
      - Execute a find command for GlobalConnectionDuration seconds in GlobalConnectionThreads threads.
