Description: |
  This workload was created to reproduce SERVER-53853: Large buildup of mongos to mongod connections and
  low performance with secondaryPreferred reads. For running both with and without sharding enabled.
  Note that this test was originally two separate files, ConnectionsBuildup.yml and ConnectionsBuildupNoSharding.yml,
  but was merged into one as part of PERF-4347.
