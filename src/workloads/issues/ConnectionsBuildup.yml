  This workload was created to reproduce SERVER-53853: Large buildup of mongos to mongod connections and
  low performance with secondaryPreferred reads. This workload was originally two separate files,
  ConnectionsBuildup.yml and ConnectionsBuildupNoSharding.yml. It was merged into a single file when
  "OnlyRunInInstance: sharded" became an option.
