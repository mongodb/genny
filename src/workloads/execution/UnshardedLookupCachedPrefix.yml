Description: |
  This test exercises $lookup with a uncorrelated prefix against an unsharded collection.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating an empty sharded collection distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running $lookup's with cacheable subpipeline prefixes.
