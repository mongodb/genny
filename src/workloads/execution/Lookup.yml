Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $lookup where either the local or foreign collection is
  sharded. When both collections are unsharded, the pipeline should be moved to the
  LookupInUnshardedEnvironment workload, so the query can be tested on replica sets as well. We may
  want to compare results across the two files, so the loading stage (and some queries) should be
  kept as similar as possible.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating empty sharded collections distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running targeted and untargeted $lookups.

GlobalDefaults:
  ShardedColl0: &ShardedColl0 Collection0
