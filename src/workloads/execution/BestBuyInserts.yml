Description: |
  This workload measures bulk insert performance with the BestBuy dataset used in some other
  workloads. It's main purpose is to compare the insert performance with columnar indexes to inserts
  without them. To get a better illustration, it measures insert performance in three scenarios:
   - No indexes present
   - "Default" indexes present - a set of indexes that are typically present on the Best Buy dataset,
     those that would be useful for the typical query workloads.
   - Only a column store index. A column store index isn't expected to realistically replace all of
     those indexes in production, but it could replace some and knowing it's relative performance
     cost could help make that decision.

  In order to run this workload, the bestbuy dataset must be present already in the database under
  test. This is designed to test insert performance in more of a steady-state and hopefully I/O
  bound mongod.

  The workload consists of the following phases and actors:
   - Bulk inserting with the deefault indexes. (SamplingLoader used to generate artificial inserts)
   - Drop all non-_id indexes (RunCommand Actor)
   - Measure bulk inserting again (SamplingLoader)
   - Build the column store index (RunCommand Actor)
   - Measure bulk inserting again (SamplingLoader)
