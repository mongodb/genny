Description: |
  Deletes a range of documents using the BATCHED_DELETE query exec stage both in isolation and while
  performing writes on another collection. Introduces secondary indexes on the collection where the
  mass deletion is issued to measure the impact of additional work per document deletion on
  concurrent write latency. Tests deletes on documents of size ~1KB then deletes on documents of
  ~10MB.
