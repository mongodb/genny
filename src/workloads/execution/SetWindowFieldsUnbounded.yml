Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $setWindowFields with an [unbounded, unbounded] window.
  This case is interesting because it requires two passes over the documents (within each
  partition): one pass to compute the window function, and one pass to write the new field to
  each document.  If any partition is too large, it has to spill.  Also, internally we $sort by the
  partition key, so that can also spill, depending on the collection size and available indexes.

  We can divide this up into 4 cases:
    1. Nothing spills.
    2. Only the $sort spills.
    3. Only the $_internalSetWindowFields spills.
    4. Both the $sort and the $_internalSetWindowFields spill.

  - To control whether the $sort spills, we can use an index, or not.
  - To control whether the $_internalSetWindowFields spills, we can change the cardinality of
    the partition key.
