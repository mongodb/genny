Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $graphLookup against an unsharded foreign collection.
  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating an empty sharded collection distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running $graphLookup's.
