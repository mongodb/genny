Description: |
  This test establishes a baseline for time-based range deletes on time-series collections.

  We have 1000 independent sensors which will each have 100 buckets, and each bucket has 100
  measurements.

  The buckets have the meta field, 'sensorId', with values from 0 to 999, each of which has 100
  measurements with timestamps within an hour with 36-second intervals. For example, in a bucket,
  the measurements look like:
  {t: 2023-01-01T5:00:00, m: 42, ...},
  {t: 2023-01-01T5:00:36, m: 42, ...},
  ...
  {t: 2023-01-01T5:59:24, m: 42, ...}

  Then we delete data that spans across three buckets for each series, causing two partial-bucket
  deletions and one full-bucket deletion. This tests the use case of data correction where the
  application deletes data within some time ranges.
