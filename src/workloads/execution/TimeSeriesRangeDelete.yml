Description: |
  This test establishes a baseline for time-based range deletes on time-series collections.

  We have 1000 independent sensors which will each have 100 buckets, and each bucket has 100
  measurements.

  Then we delete data that spans across three buckets for each series, causing two partial-bucket
  deletions and one full-bucket deletion. This tests the use case of data correction where the
  application deletes data within some time ranges.
