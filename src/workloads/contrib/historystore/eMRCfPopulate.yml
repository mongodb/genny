# Test workload to evaluate Storage Engine behavior when running in a
# degraded replica set with or without eMRCf enabled.  A "degraded" replica
# set here means one without an active majority of data bearing nodes.  I.e.,
# a PSA set with the Secondary offline.

# Currently the workload is split across several yml files because we need to script
# some things between different parts.  This is the population phase.  It starts with
# an empty database and populates it with an initial set of documents.  We create a mix
# of small (50-200 byte) and large (200-1000 byte) documents in a 10:1 ratio.

# This section contains shared definitions that are used in the workload.
# These defaults should match the similar declarations in the yml files for the other
# parts of the workload.

  Random10KInt: &rand_10k_int {^RandomInt: {min: 1, max: 10000}}

  ShortString: &short_string {^RandomString: {length: 16}}
  RandomShortString: &rand_short_string {^RandomString: {length: {^RandomInt: {min: 10, max: 160}}}}

  # Documents have a key field.  Large and small documents use different, non-overlapping key
  # ranges so that we can choose one type of document or the other in later phases.
  # Key space for large and small docs should be 1% of the number of documents of each type.
  # This means that a updateOne request to a random key will select among 1% of the documents:
  # the oldest doc with each key value.
  SmallDocKey: &small_doc_key {^RandomInt: {min: 0, max: 100000}}
  LargeDocKey: &large_doc_key {^RandomInt: {min: 1000000, max: 1010000}}

# Each document has two keys.  A primary key (key1) is assigned randomly from the keyspace.
# The number of documents in the collection is 100x the range of the primary key.  So we will
# wind up with, on average, 100 documets per key value.  This is a hack so we can target tests
# at a set of "hot" documents.  Calling updateOne (or any of the other *One operations) with
# a random key will target the oldest document with that key value, thus 1% of the dataset
#
# The secondary key (key2) is a random value selected from 1 to 1000.  It can be used (awkwardly)
# to broaden the set of documents that a test targets.  For example, issuing a pair of operations
# to random primary keys and one selecting key2 <= 500 and the other selecting key2 > 500 will
# target two documents for each primary key value, thus targeting 2 documents for each key
# value, or 2% of the population.
