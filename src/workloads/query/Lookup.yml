Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $lookup where either the local or foreign collection is
  sharded. When both collections are unsharded, the pipeline should be moved to the
  LookupWithOnlyUnshardedColls workload, so the query can be tested on replica sets as well. We may
  want to compare results across the two files, so the loading stage (and some queries) should be
  kept as similar as possible.

  Note: this workload runs only on sharded clusters.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating empty sharded collections distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running $lookups. This includes but is not limited to cases where the top-level pipelines are
       targeted and untargeted, the subpipelines are targeted and untargeted, and the subpipelines
       have cacheable prefixes.
