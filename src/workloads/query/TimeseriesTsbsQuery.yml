Owner: Query Integration
Description: |
  This workload runs different time-series optimizations with the tsbs dataset. During development,
  This workload runs queries from the tsbs_query benchmark in Genny. It allows us to cross-check
  the results of the TSBS benchmarks, collect additional measurements, profile individual queries,
  and extend some of the queries as needed. The data is preloaded by the dsi configuration. See
  'configurations/test_control/test_control.tsbs_query_genny.yml' for all  the details. There are 20736000
  documents in the collection. There are some differences between the queries in this workload and tsbs,
  but we do not expect these differences to significantly affect runtime:
  1. TSBS will generate a random start time between the start/end time of the workload for every query type.
  We hard code our time values, since genny does not currently support date arithmetic, nor storing a fixed
  value from randomized generation.
  2. TSBS randomizes which measurement fields to group by, we do not randomize these fields. Since all the fields
  are random integers between 0-100 we don't expect different fields to have significant runtime differences.

  # TSBS constructs a time windows of various sizes (1 hour, 8 hours, 12 hours) from a uniformly
  # random start-time within this time-period. Ideally, we would do this as well, but currently
  # genny doesn't support storing randomized date values as variables, so we will fix a starting
  # value and increment it each time the query runs.
