Description: |
  Run tests for $percentile accumulator over 2 data distributions. We create a new collection for
  each distribution as putting the fields into the same document might be impacted by how much
  bson needs to be parsed to access the field but we want to make sure we compare apples to apples.

  During development we did not see significant differences in runtime between various data
  distributions, and therefore scoped down this test to create a normal distribution and a dataset
  created from 5 different distributions.

# Phase descriptions:
# 1 - create normal distribution collection
# 2 - compute percentiles
# 3 - compute percentiles with multiple groups
# 4 - drop collection
# 5 - create mix distributions collection
# 6 - compute percentiles
# 7 - compute percentiles with multiple groups

Keywords:
  - group
  - percentile
