Description: |
  SERVER-63099 addresses a correctness issue in how we constant fold during multiplication and addition.
  This workload tests the impact of the constant folding optimization in the aggregation pipeline to better
  understand the impact of SERVER-63099 and hopefully mitigate the performance regression with other optimizations.

  The first pipeline is the control and should be unaffected by changes to the associativity of multiplication in the optimizer
  because it only contains constants.

  The three pipelines in this workload that contain a fieldpath should have different performance characteristics depending
  on the level of associativity in the optimizer.

  - Full associativity:
    All three pipelines should have similar performance statistics because all 1000 constants are rearranged to be
    folded into one another, ignoring the order of operations in the original pipeline.

  - No associativity (simple correctness fix):
    All three pipelines should have similar performance that is significantly worse than full associativity, because
    each document in the pipeline will require 1000 multiplication operations because no constant folding will happen
    with $multiply marked as non-associative.

  - Left associativity (implementation of a correct optimization):
    StartingFieldpath should see no regression from the "no associativity" case.
    MiddleFieldpath should see a speedup that puts its performance in between "no associativity" and "full associativity".
    TailingFieldpath should speed up back to its performance in the "full associativity" case.
