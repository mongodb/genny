Description: |
  This test is designed to test a hybrid scoring like use-case, but without using any atlas search
  features, since (at the time of this writing) they are complex to set up in our test
  infrastructure.

  Our made up scenario to mimic this use case will be as follows:
  - Our collection will have documents which mimic businesses such as restaurants.
  - Our query will request certain restaurants near a point, and want to rank them in a fused order
    based on both their distance from the point and their average rating. (Preferring the first
    result to be one that is reasonably close with the highest reviews).

  The phases are:
  0. Create collection
  1. Insert data + create indexes
  2. Quiesce
  3. Rank Fusion style pipeline style #1
  4. Quiesce
  5. Rank Fusion style pipeline style #2
  6. Quiesce
  7. Rank Fusion style pipeline style #3

  We use a couple different styles of expressing the same pipeline since they all get the job done,
  but currently perform differently. In the long run, it would be good to track performance of all
  of them in case a user typed it a certain way and doesn't realize some performance gains that
  another version of the syntax uses.
