Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of querying for data in a timeseries collection using a 2dsphere index.

  The phases are:
  0. Create collection
  1. Insert events + create index
  2. Quiesce
  3. $geoWithin
  4. Quiesce
  5. $geoNear

GlobalDefaults:
  # Schema constants.
  dbname: &db test
  fieldName: &field "numeric"
  index: &index
    keys: { location: "2dsphere" }

  # Data distribution constants.
  # To insert more efficiently, pick a big-ish batch size.
  # This shouldn't really affect the resulting collection though.
  insertBatchSize: &insertBatchSize 30000
  # Events are 10 seconds apart: 10,000 ms.
  docIntervalMillis: &docIntervalMillis 10000
  # Let's generate 1000 series of data.
  # Note that the timestamp does not restart when we change from one series to the next, which is
  # unrealistic. In real life the events from all 1000 series would be happening around the same
  # time. But it shouldn't matter for this test, because the query and the index both ignore the
  # time field.
  docsPerSeries: &docsPerSeries 1000
  # Let's generate 120 days worth of data. That means (120 * 24 * 60 * 60) seconds, which is
  # (120 * 24 * 60 * 60 / 10) = 1036800 events. This number is roughly 1,000,000, which means we
  # have roughly 1,000 events in each of our 1,000 series.
  documentCount: &documentCount 1036800
  # Since we have a relatively small amount of data, we don't want to use an area that's too
  # big (such as the entire Earth, or a whole continent). That would make the data very
  # sparse over that area. These values roughly correspond to New York State, which is
  # hopefully a good scale.
  minX: &minX -80.0
  maxX: &maxX -73.0
  minY: &minY 40.0
  maxY: &maxY 45.0
  # Suppose each sensor moves at around 60 mph or 100 kph.
  # This comes out to around 30 m/s.
  # Events are 10 seconds apart, so that's 300m per event.
  # 90 degrees of longitude or latitude is roughly 10,000 km = 10,000,000m.
  # So (300m / event) * (90 deg / 10,000,000m) = 0.0027 deg / event.
  # This is very rough, and doesn't account for how 1 degree longitude has a different length
  # at different latitudes. The idea is just to get roughly the right scale.
  # Another check: 0.0027 degrees per doc and 1,000 docs per series means 2.7 degrees per
  # series, which is roughly the scale of our min/max X/Y.
  distPerDoc: &distPerDoc 0.0027

  # Other abbreviations.
