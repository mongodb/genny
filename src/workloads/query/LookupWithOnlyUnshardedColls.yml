Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $lookup when both the local and foreign collections are
  unsharded. When one of the collections is sharded, the pipeline should be moved to the
  Lookup workload, so that this file can continue to be tested in an unsharded environment. We may
  want to compare results across the two files, so the loading stage (and some queries) should be
  kept as similar as possible.

  Note: this workload runs on replica sets and sharded clusters.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Populating collections with data.
    2. Fsync.
    3. Running $lookups.
