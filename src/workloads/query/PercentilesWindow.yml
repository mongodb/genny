Description: |
  This tests $percentile window functions over various bounded window sizes. Bounded window
  functions use a different implementation (an accurate algorithm) than the $percentile accumulator,
  which uses an approximate algorithm. Therefore, we need to measure computing percentiles over
  differently sized windows. We test a few cases:
  1. Small document-based removable windows
  2. Large document-based removable windows
  3. Non-removable document-based window (will use an approximate algorithm).
  4. Small range-based removable windows
  5. Large range-based removable windows
  6. Non-removable range-based window (will use an approximate algorithm).

  We compare the speed of $percentile over these windows with $minN.
  We do not test different percentile values here, since those are tested in a micro-benchmark, and
  do not show significant differences.
