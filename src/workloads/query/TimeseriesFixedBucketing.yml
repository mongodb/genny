Owner: Query Integration
Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of the time series optimization when the collection has
  fixed buckets. This workload uses tsbs data that is imported in the dsi configuration. See
  'configurations/test_control/test_control.fixed_bucketing.yml' for all the details.
  The data is set up with the fixed bucketing parameters set to 3600 and the timeField is "time"
  and the metaField is "tags". There are 20736000 documents in the collection.

Keywords:
  - timeseries
  - aggregate
  - group

GlobalDefaults:
  Database: &Database test
  Collection: &Collection coll
  maxPhases: &maxPhases 10
  Repeat: &Repeat 5

# The dates below are chosen for different $match queries. The dates in the tsbs dataset are
# between 2016-01-01 and 2016-01-25. The dates for the queries were chosen to be in the middle of the
# dataset. Date0 and Date1 should be close together, since we want to measure the performance
# improvement of removing the 'eventFilter' in the $match queries.
Date0: &DateForBucketAlign
  LoadConfig:
    Path: "../../phases/query/GetBsonDate.yml"
    Key: GetBsonDate
    Parameters:
      date: "2016-01-13T01:00:00"

Date1: &DateForBucketNotAlign
  LoadConfig:
    Path: "../../phases/query/GetBsonDate.yml"
    Key: GetBsonDate
    Parameters:
      date: "2016-01-13T01:03:02"
