Description: |
  This test exercises the behavior of $graphLookup when both the local and foreign collections are
  unsharded. When one of the collections is sharded, the pipeline should be moved to the
  GraphLookup workload, so that this file can continue to be tested in an unsharded environment. We
  may want to compare results across the two files, so the loading stage (and some queries) should
  be kept as similar as possible.

  Note: this workload runs on replica sets and sharded clusters.

  The workload consists of the following phases:
    1. Creating an empty sharded collection distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating collections with data.
    3. Fsync.
    4. Running $graphLookups.
