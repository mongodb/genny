Description: |
  This workload stresses the query execution engine by running queries with complex logical
  expressions that never match a document in the collection.
  Each workload name consists of several parts: '{SyntaxType}{PredicateType}'.
  'SyntaxType' can be:
    - 'AggregationExpression' means expressions which can be used inside $expr
    - 'MatchExpression' means operators of the find command match predicate language
  'PredicateType' can be:
    - 'DeepPredicate' means query with deeply nested expressions
    - 'WidePredicate' means query where operators have a large number of arguments
    - 'SingletonPredicateWithDeepFieldpaths' means query with a single equality predicate where
      nested fieldpaths like '$a.b.c' are used
    - 'WidePredicateWithDeepFieldpaths' means a wide query where nested fieldpaths like '$a.b.c'
      are used
    - 'MixedPredicate' means query which combines wide and deep types
    - 'TargetPath' and 'MissingPath' mean query which targets a path present only in some documents
    - 'MissingPathSuffix' means query is searching a path whose suffix cannot be found in the
    document
