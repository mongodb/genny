Description: |
  This workload measures the performance of updating large documents in a replica set. First, it
  inserts large documents, each containing 100 nested objects with 1K fields inside of them. Then it
  runs a series of simple updates. Each update is setting only one field and has write concern
  "majority". The output of this workload is ops/sec, indicating how many of these simple updates
  were finished in a period of time.
