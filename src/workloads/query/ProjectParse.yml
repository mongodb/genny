Description: |
  Test $project parsing performance for small and large number of fields. We previously (before August 2023)
  had a quadratic $project parsing algorithm which would take hours for the largest stages, due to a linear
  search through all currently parsed fields rather than a map lookup. It should now take milliseconds to parse.
  This issue was fixed by SERVER-78580, and discovered by SERVER-62509.
