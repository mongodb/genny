Description: |
  This workload is a mixed workload to test the maximum throughput that
  can be achieved by change event application (CEA). The workload starts Mongosync
  on a cluster with an empty initial dataset, waits for it to transition to
  CEA and then starts inserting documents on the source cluster.

Keywords:
- c2c
- replication
- cluster to cluster sync
