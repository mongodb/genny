Description: |
  Pipeline: Memory -> Match -> Project -> Memory
  Input Documents: 8M
  BatchSize: 1k

  Simulates the scenario where the stream processor only needs to match a
  small portion of the ingested documents. In this specific case, 8M documents
  are ingested but the $match stage will only match against ~0.3% of the ingested
  documents.

Keywords:
  - streams

  DatabaseName: &DatabaseName test
  TenantId: &TenantId test
  StreamProcessorName: &StreamProcessorName sp
  StreamProcessorId: &StreamProcessorId spid

  # Genny workload client typically has 16 CPUs, so use 16 inserter threads each inserting
  # 500 batches of 1k documents, so a total of 8M documents, which will all have unique keys
  # for the window so this will generate 8M keys on the open window.
