Description: |
  Pipeline: Memory -> Tumbling Window (Group) -> Memory
  Documents: 16M
  BatchSize: 1k
  The tumbling window will group by the auction ID. The first 8M documents will all have unique
  auction IDs and will measure the performance of the scenario where every document results in
  inserting a new key into the window. The latter 8M documents will all have an existing auction ID
  and will measure the performance of the scenario where every document results in updating an
  existing key in the window.

  # Genny workload client typically has 16 CPUs, so use 16 inserter threads each inserting
  # 500 batches of 1k documents, so a total of 8M documents, which will all have unique keys
  # for the window so this will generate 8M keys on the open window.
