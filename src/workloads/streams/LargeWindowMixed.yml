Description: |
  Pipeline: Memory -> Tumbling Window (Group) -> Memory
  Input Documents: 16M
  BatchSize: 1k

  Simulates the scenario where the watermark is constantly advancing every some documents
  and constantly opening new windows and closing old window over the watermark span of 10
  seconds on a tumbling window with an interval of 1 second and an allow lateness of 1 second.
  Each window will ingest 1.6M documents, with ~400k unique keys, so each window on close will
  output atmost 400k documents.

Keywords:
- streams

  # Genny workload client typically has 16 CPUs, so use 16 inserter threads each inserting
  # 500 batches of 1k documents, so a total of 8M documents, which will all have unique keys
  # for the window so this will generate 8M keys on the open window.

  # Manually construct 1k batch rather than using ^Array function so that all documents in a
  # single 1k batch have the same timestamp. And since this is across 16 threads, each timestamp
  # will have (16 * 1000) documents, and with a `IncDate` step size of 10 milliseconds, each one
  # second window will have (16 * 1000 * 100) documents => 1,600,000 documents.
