  Pipeline: Memory -> Tumbling Window (Group, Sort, Limit 1k) -> Memory
  Input Documents: 8M
  BatchSize: 1k

  Simulates the scenario where input documents are fed into a tumlbing window that
  groups by a large key (URL), then sorts by the aggregated price, and only emits
  the top 1k aggregated documents by price. All 8M documents will have a random URL
  assigned to them.

Keywords:
- streams

  DatabaseName: &DatabaseName test
  StreamProcessorName: &StreamProcessorName sp

  # Genny workload client typically has 16 CPUs, so use 16 inserter threads each inserting
  # 500 batches of 1k documents, so a total of 8M documents, which will all have unique keys
  # for the window so this will generate 8M keys on the open window.
