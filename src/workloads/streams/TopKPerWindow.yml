Description: |
  Pipeline: Memory -> Tumbling Window (Group, Sort, Limit 1k) -> Memory
  Documents: 8M
  BatchSize: 1k

  The tumbling window will group by the URL, and all 8M documents will have a
  random URL assigned to them. This is meant to test the performance of a
  window pipeline that groups by a large key, sorts, and limits.

Keywords:
- streams

GlobalDefaults:
  DatabaseName: &DatabaseName test
  StreamProcessorName: &StreamProcessorName sp

  # Genny workload client typically has 16 CPUs, so use 16 inserter threads each inserting
  # 500 batches of 1k documents, so a total of 8M documents, which will all have unique keys
  # for the window so this will generate 8M keys on the open window.
