Description: |
  Streaming pipeline that runs with a stateful window operator on the input data. This
  is meant to stress the window operator, which is a commonly used operator. This will
  only create a single key within every 10s window since its just looking for the max
  value across all events, so this is just testing the throughput for the window operator.
