  This example extends CrudActorFSM.yml, with the addition of operations associated with
  transitions, in addition to states. We have not implemented this functionality at this point, but
  are adding this example definition in case someone wants the functionality at some future
  point. It uses the CrudActor to implement a FSM. Choices are declared with weights that are
  converted into probabilities.

  TODO: Remove this file from skipped dry run list when implemented
  (src/lamplib/src/genny/tasks/dry_run.py)

  There is an initial state vector, with weight. Each actor instance will probabilistically and
  independently choose it's initial state based on the weights.

  Each state specifies a list of transitions. The next transition is picked probabilistically, based
  on the transition weights. Transitions may experience delay (sleepBefore, sleepAfter) before or
  after executing a (possibly empty) set of operations, before transitioning to the next state. The
  state itself may execute its own set of operations.

  By default the system will measure the latency to execute each set of operations (per transition
  or per state), and each operation. The latencies associated with each transition and state are
  tracked separately.

  This example workload is a toy example modeling the state of 5 smart phones. The model has four
  states for each phone: On, Off, Sleep, and Error, and transitions between those states. In this
  example, there is monitoring for the smart phones, and the database gets updated based on the
  state of the phones and state changes. The workload (monitoring app) tracks the current phone state in
  one document (update operations). Note that this is separate than the state machinery tracking of
  state. The workload also counts the number of transitions from state On to each of
  the other three states (also update operations).

      # always non-blocking. When the phase ends, the state machine will finish any open operations,
      # and then exit. It if is waiting for a delay, it will exit immediately. This is required as
