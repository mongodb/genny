Description: |
  Demonstrate the ChooseFromDataset generator. The ChooseFromDataset generator takes the following
  arguments:
  - file: Required - A path to a file to read from.
  - sequential: Optional - If set to true, read sequentially from the file. Otherwise, read randomly from the file. Defaults to false.
  - startFromLine: Optional - Only has effect if reading sequentially. The line of the file to start reading from (0-indexed). Defaults to 0.
  The file should exist and shouldn't be empty. As an example you can use familynames.txt, names.txt and airports_codes.txt.
  If you specify a relative path the pathfile will depend on your current working directory (cwd).
  If running in evergreen, the relative path needs to be: ./src/genny/src/workloads/datasets/.
  If running locally, the relative path needs to be: ./src/workloads/datasets/.
  When reading sequentially, if the end of the file is reached, the reading pointer goes back to the beginning of the file.
