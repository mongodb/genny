Description: |

  This workload illustrates how to think of Phases happening
  simultaneously and how to configure Repeat and Duration
  when you have more than one Actor in a Workload.

  Start by quickly looking at the actual workload yaml below

  Although we write workloads by listing each Actor and then
  listing each Phase for that Actor, Genny workloads actually
  operate in order of each Phase. We construct each Actor and
  then start Phase 0. We wait until all Actors say that they
  are done with Phase 0 and then we move on to Phase 1, etc.
  Actors using PhaseLoop automatically do this.

  It may help to think of the Actor yamls as being written in
  parallel rather than in sequence

      Actors:
      - Type: HelloWorld             - Type: HelloWorld
        Name: A                        Name: B
        Threads: 10                    Threads: 2
        Phases:                        Phases:

        - Message: A.0                 - Message: B.0
          Duration: 2 seconds            Repeat: 10

        - Message: A.1                 - Message: B.1
          Blocking: None                 Repeat: 1e3

  The HelloWorld Actor echoes its "Message" parameter in a
  loop.

  There will be 10 threads running HelloWorld with name "A"
  and 2 threads running with name "B".

  == Phase 0 ==

            A                          B
        Message: A.0              Message: B.0
        Duration: 2 seconds       Repeat: 10

  The first phase (Phase 0) starts and all 12 threads (10 from
  A and 2 from B) start echoing their respective messages. At
  each iteration, the PhaseLoop checks to see if it should
  iterate again.

      Actor A is configured to run its iteration in Phase 0
      for 2 seconds, so each of its 10 threads will loop and
      echo "A.0" for 2 seconds.

      Actor B is configured to run its iteration in Phase 1
      only 10 times. So it will echo "B.0" 10 times. Almost
      certainly this will take less than 2 seconds (the amount
      of time Actor A requires to complete Phase 0). In this
      case, Actor B is "done" with its actions in the current
      Phase so its 2 threads will wait and do nothing until
      the next Phase. Compare this with what Actor A does in
      Phase 1 described next.

  == Phase 1 ==

  After Phase 0 comes Phase 1.

          A                  B
      Message: A.1      Message: B.1
      Blocking: None    Repeat: 1e3

  Notice how Actor A does not specify either a Repeat nor a
  Duration. This means A is considered a "background" Actor
  for this Phase. Since it doesn't specify Repeat or Duration
  it must specify Blocking: None as a precaution against
  footgunning. It will run as long as it can while other
  Actors are doing their work. This is useful if you want to
  have some "background" operation such as doing a db.ping()
  or a collection.drop() etc.

  Actor B's 2 threads will echo "B.1" 1e3 (1000) times and
  Actor A's 10 threads will echo "A.1" for however long it
  takes B to do this.

  == Potential Gotchas ==

  1. You can specify both `Repeat` and `Duration` for a Phase.
     The larger of the two wins. If you specify `Repeat: 1e40`
     and `Duration: 1ms` it will repeat 1e40 times even if it
     takes much longer than 1ms.

  2. It is undefined behavior if no Actors specify a Duration
     or Repeat for a Phase. It does not currently cause an
     infinite-loop, but we don't check for this situation
     (which is almost certainly a mis-configuration) at setup
     time.
