Description: |
  This is an introductory workload that shows how to write a workload in Genny.
  This workload writes a few messages to the screen.

Actors:
- Name: HelloWorld
  Type: HelloWorld
  Threads: 2
  Phases:
  - Message: Hello Phase 0 🐳
    Duration: 50 milliseconds
    # GlobalRate: 99 per 88 nanoseconds
    # SleepBefore: 11 milliseconds
    # SleepAfter: 17 microseconds
    # MetricsName: 🐳Message
  - Message: Hello Phase 1 👬
    Repeat: 100
    # To limit the throughput to a percentage of the max, specify global rate as a percent.
    # This will run at max throughput for 1 minute or 3 iterations, whichever is longer,
    # then limit to a fraction of that for the rest of the phase.
    # GlobalRate: 80%
  - LoadConfig:
      Path: ../../phases/HelloWorld/ExamplePhase2.yml
      Key: UseMe  # Only load the YAML structure from this top-level key.
      Parameters:
        Repeat: 2

# As an alternate phase syntax, use the following for an actor that
# runs a total of 3 phases, active in phases named 0 and 2 and Nop for the rest:
# Phases:
#   OnlyActiveInPhases:
#     Active: [0, 2]
#     NopInPhasesUpTo: 2
#     PhaseConfig:
#       Message: Alternate Phase 1
#       Repeat: 100
