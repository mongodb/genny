Description: |
  This is an introductory workload that shows how to write a workload in Genny.
  This workload writes a few messages to the screen.

Actors:
  - Name: HelloWorld
    Type: HelloWorld
    Threads: &Threads 2
    Phases:
      - Message: Hello Phase 0 🐳
        Duration: 50 milliseconds
        # GlobalRate: 99 per 88 nanoseconds
        # SleepBefore: 11 milliseconds
        # SleepAfter: 17 microseconds
        # MetricsName: 🐳Message
      - Message: Hello Phase 1 👬
        Repeat: 100
        # To limit the throughput to a percentage of the max, specify global rate as a percent.
        # This will run at max throughput for 1 minute or 3 iterations, whichever is longer,
        # then limit to a fraction of that for the rest of the phase.
        # GlobalRate: 80%
      - LoadConfig:
          Path: ../../phases/HelloWorld/ExamplePhase2.yml
          Key: UseMe # Only load the YAML structure from this top-level key.
          Parameters:
            Repeat: 2
      # To perform arithmetic use the ^NumExpr preprocessor directive
      - Message: Hello Phase 3
        TotalMessageCount: &TotalMessageCount 100
        Repeat:
          ^NumExpr:
            withExpression: "messages / threads"
            andValues: {messages: *TotalMessageCount, threads: *Threads}
      # To concatenate strings, use the ^PreprocessorFormatString preprocessor directive. It works
      # similarly to the ^FormatString generator.
      - Message:
          ^PreprocessorFormatString:
            format: "%s Phase %d"
            withArgs: ["Hello", 4]
        Repeat: 1

# As an alternate phase syntax, use the following for an actor that
# runs a total of 3 phases, active in phases named 0 and 2 and Nop for the rest:
# Phases:
#   OnlyActiveInPhases:
#     Active: [0, 2]
#     NopInPhasesUpTo: 2
#     PhaseConfig:
#       Message: Alternate Phase 1
#       Repeat: 100
