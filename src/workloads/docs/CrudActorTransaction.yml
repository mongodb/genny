  Type: CrudActor
  Database: testdb
  Phases:
  - Repeat: 1
    Collection: test
    Operations:
    - OperationName: withTransaction
      OperationCommand:
        ThrowOnFailure: false  # Transactions are allowed to fail.
        RecordFailure: true  # We still want to record the metrics even if the transaction is rolled back.
        Options:
          # Use a non-default TransactionOption MaxCommitTimeMs.
          MaxCommitTime: 500 milliseconds
          WriteConcern:
            Level: majority
            Journal: true
          ReadConcern:
            Level: snapshot
          ReadPreference:
            ReadMode: primaryPreferred
            MaxStaleness: 1000 seconds
        OperationsInTransaction:
        - OperationName: bulkWrite
          OperationCommand:
            WriteOperations:
            - WriteCommand: insertOne
              Document: {a: 1}
            - WriteCommand: updateOne
              Filter: {a: 1}
              Update: {$set: {a: 5}}
            Options:
              Ordered: true
            # The OnSession: true flag tells the driver to use a logical session. The actor will use the
            # same session for the duration of a phase.
            OnSession: true
