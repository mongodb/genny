Description:
  The LoggingActor exists so DSI and Evergreen don't quit
  your workload for not outputting anything to stdout.
  (They do this in case your workload has timed-out.) If
  you don't want to add periodic logging to your Actor
  (you probably don't because logging would be done by
  every thread and would probably make your workload super
  verbose), then you can drop this Actor at the end of
  your Workload YAML and configure this Actor to log
  something periodically in Phases that are likely to run
  longer than a few minutes.

  This workload "works", but it basically just exits right
  away without actually logging anything because the
  LoggingActor insists on being a "background" Actor that
  can never block a Phase from completing, and it only
  actually logs every 10000 iterations.

  To use this Actor, copy/paste the below block into
  your workload YAML and create a Phase block for
  every Phase that may last longer than a few minutes.

Actors:
- Name: LoggingActor
  Type: LoggingActor
  Threads: 1 # must be 1
  Phases:
  - Phase: 0
    LogEvery: 15 minutes # TimeSpec
    Blocking: None # must be Blocking:None
