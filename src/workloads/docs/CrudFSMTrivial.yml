Description: |
  Trivial tests of CRUD FSM functionality without timing. See CrudActorFSM.yml for documentation on
  the functionality. This has 3 active states and one absorbing state. It inserts a document every
  time it enters a state, and executes 10 transitions of each state machine. All threads start in
  one of the first two states. You can track the progress by the inserted documents. Each thread
  includes it's ActorId in the documents.
