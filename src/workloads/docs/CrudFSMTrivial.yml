Description: |
  Trivial tests of CRUD FSM functionality without timing. This has 3 active states and one absorbing
  state. It inserts a document every time it enters a state, and executes 10 transitions of each
  state machine. All threads start in one of the first two states. You can track the progress by the
  inserted documents. Each thread includes it's ActorId in the documents.
