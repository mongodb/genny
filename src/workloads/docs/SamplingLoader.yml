Description: |
  This workload demonstrates using the SamplingLoader to expand the contents of a collection. This
  actor will take a random sample of a configurable size and re-insert the same documents, with the
  option of transforming them with an agg pipeline. It will project out the "_id" field before
  re-inserting to avoid duplicate key errors.

  Collection: &Collection sampling_loader_demo

# This is just to seed the collection with 40 documents so that we'll have some sample data to draw

    # Number of documents in a single insert operation.

    # Number of insert operations. The total number of documents to be inserted is
    # Batches * InsertBatchSize.
    Batches: 2
    # Number of documents in the sample. The loader will cycle through the sampled docs, using them
    # as templates for the ones to be incerted, until it inserts the requested number of batches.
    # For example, if the sample size is set to 1, exactly one document is sampled from the original
    # dataset and reused as a template for _all_ of the inserted docs. And if the sample size is
    # equal to the insert batch size, each sampled document will be "re-inserted" as many times as
    # the number of batches.
    #
    # Using a small sample size may be useful if you want to measure performance of inserting many
    # documents that don't need a variety of input data, as the small sample size allows for the
    # random cursor optimization during sampling.
    #
    # Note that the sample size does not need to be correlated or a multiple of the insert batch size
    # or number of batches.
    #
    # If the sample size is omitted, the loader will set it to the number of the requested documents
    # (Batches * InsertBatchSize) so that each sampled document is re-inserted exactly once.

  - {Nop: true}
  - {Nop: true}

# In this case we use multiple threads.
# With multiple threads, each thread will operate independently, including in gathering the sample.
# A word of caution: because there is no synchronization between threads, this means it is possible
# for one thread to observe a document that was inserted by another SamplingLoader in the same
# phase. Plan accordingly.
#
# The total number of documents inserted then will be Threads * Batches * InsertBatchSize, here
# 4 * 5 * 20 = 400.
#
# Note this is somewhat different than the configuration of 'Loader', 'MonotonicLoader', etc. which
# accept an overall document count target which gets divided amongst the threads.

# Now we'll demonstrate the ability to specify a pipeline suffix to tack on after the one with

# shown, to provide identifiability to the docs inserted.

    # Note again: each thread is independent, so 'nTimesSoFar' will refer to that thread's count,
    # since each thread will run the document generator independently. As mentioned earlier, it is
    # possible that in a race condition one thread will observe another thread's inserted documents
    # in the sample. Here that would mean we might see a document that already has the 'y' and
    # 'nTimesSoFar' fields present. In this case they will be overridden with new values though, so
    # it would be harmless. The end result should be that we see Batches * InsertBatchSize = 100 new
    # documents per thread, and the numbers 1 through 100 repeated per thread accordingly in the
    # 'nTimesSoFar' field.
