# The Loader actor loads a fixed number of documents using a fixed
# number of threads to a set of collections. The number of collections created
# depends on the Phase.MultipleThreadsPerCollection, Phase.CollectionCount,
# Phase.Threads and Actor.Threads values and is explained later.
#
# Actor.Threads specifies the total number of threads created and used by the loader.
#
# Phase.MultipleThreadsPerCollection controls whether there is a collections per thread or a
# threads per collection load (defaults to false, so at most one thread will write to each collection).
#
# When MultipleThreadsPerCollection is false, the actor will use at most one thread to load
# one of more collections.
# In this mode of operation the loader Actor will:
#  * create a total of  math.floor(Phase.CollectionCount / Phase.Threads) *  Actor.Threads collections.
#  * create Actor.Threads loader threads.
#  * each loader thread will create math.floor(Phase.CollectionCount / Phase.Threads) collections.
# Both Actor.Threads and Phase.Threads must be set in this mode.
#
# When MultipleThreadsPerCollection is true, the actor will use at least one thread to load
# each collection.
# In this mode of operation the loader will:
#  * creates a total of Phase.CollectionCount collections.
#  * each collection will be populated by (Actor.Thread / Phase.CollectionCount) threads.
#  * raise an InvalidConfiguration exception if Phase.CollectionCount doesn't divide
#    evenly into Actor.Threads.
#  * raise an InvalidConfiguration exception if Phase.Threads is set.
