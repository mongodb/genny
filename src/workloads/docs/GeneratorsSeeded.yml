Description: |
  This workload demonstrates the usage of RandomSeed. Genny uses a PRNG and defaults to the
  same seed (see RNG_SEED_BASE from context.cpp). As a result every execution of the same workload
  file will generate the same random number stream and by extension the same stream of documents.

  To generate a different stream of documents, set the RandomSeed attribute. This example shares
  the same base workload Generators.yml and varies the RandomSeed and database name.
