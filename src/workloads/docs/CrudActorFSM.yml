  TODO: This functionality does not exist yet. It will be implemented in PERF-2516.  The Curd Actor
  will support FSM definition, with operations associated with each states. Choices are declared
  with weights that are converted into probabilities.

  There is an initial state vector, with weight. Each actor instance will probabilistically and
  independently choose it's initial state based on the weights.

  Each state specifies a list of transitions. The next transition is picked probabilistically, based
  on the transition weights. Transitions may experience delay (sleepBefore), before changing the
  state. The state has associated operations which execute while the FSM remains in that
  state. (Question: what happens during the transition delay? I suggest nothing)

  By default the system will measure the latency to execute each set of operations associated with a
  state, and each individual operation.

  This example workload is a toy example modeling the state of 5 smart phones. The model has four
  states for each phone: On, Off, Sleep, and Error, and transitions between those states. In this
  example, there is monitoring for the smart phones, and the database gets updated based on the
  state of the phones and state changes. The workload (monitoring app) tracks the current phone
  state in one document per phone (update operations). Note that this is separate than the state
  machinery tracking of state.

    States:

      # The states support the keywords Repeat, SleepBefore, SleepAfter, (local) Rate, and

      # per actor instance as it goes through the state machine.

      Operations:
      # A state can have (optional) a set of operations that execute upon entering the state. This
      # state updates a specific document to indicate it is in state On.

      # Note: Following the analogy to phases -- phases may be blocking or non-blocking. States are
      # always non-blocking. When the phase ends, the state machine will finish any open operations,
      # and then exit. It if is waiting for a delay, it will exit immediately. This is required as
      # there may be states with long delays.
      # Question: Should we support having a single fire operation with repeating operations? Here I
      # could invent a case where the following operation is repeat 1, but there is another
      # operation that repeats once a second while in this state. I don't know how to represent
      # that.
