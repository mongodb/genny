Description: |
  TODO: This functionality does not exist yet. It will be implemented in PERF-2516.  The Crud Actor
  will support FSM definition, with operations associated with each states. Choices are declared
  with weights that are converted into probabilities.

  TODO: Remove this file from skipped dry run list when implemented
  (src/lamplib/src/genny/tasks/dry_run.py)

  There is an initial state vector, with weight. Each actor instance will probabilistically and
  independently choose it's initial state based on the weights.

  Each state specifies a list of transitions. The next transition is picked probabilistically, based
  on the transition weights. Transitions may experience delay (sleepBefore), before changing the
  state. The state has associated operations which execute while the FSM remains in that
  state. (Question: what happens during the transition delay? I suggest nothing)

  By default the system will measure the latency to execute each set of operations associated with a
  state, and each individual operation.

  This example workload is a toy example modeling the state of 5 smart phones. The model has four
  states for each phone: On, Off, Sleep, and Error, and transitions between those states. In this
  example, there is monitoring for the smart phones, and the database gets updated based on the
  state of the phones and state changes. The workload (monitoring app) tracks the current phone
  state in one document per phone (update operations). Note that this is separate than the state
  machinery tracking of state.

    States:
    - Name: "On"  # The device is on

      # The states support the keywords Repeat, SleepBefore, SleepAfter, (local) Rate, and
      # Duration. These keywords behave the same as in Phase Control, but operate per state (i.e.,
      # per actor instance as it goes through the state machine.
      Repeat: 1

      # A state can have (optional) a set of operations that execute upon entering the state. This
      # state updates a specific document to indicate it is in state On.

      # Note: Following the analogy to phases -- phases may be blocking or non-blocking. States are
      # always non-blocking, in the sense that any sleepBefore, SleepAfter delays will be
      # interrupted to close the phase. However, any active operations will be finished.

      # For example, this phase has a 30 second duration, making it blocking. When that 30 seconds
      # end all the actors will end their phases. If an actor is in a sleepBefore or sleepAfter
      # delay, it will exit the phase. If the actor is executing a state's operations, it will
      # complete those operations, and then exit the phase.

      # each of the three other states
      Transitions:
      - To: "Off"  # Transition to this state

        # Transitions are probabilistically chosen based on weight. A transition with weight 2 is
        # twice as likely to be picked as a transition with weight 1. Weights must be greater than
        # 0.
        Weight: 1

        # Transitions also support the phase keyword sleepBefore.  For sleepBefore, the system is
        # considered to remain in it's current state. If there is a repeating action in the state,
        # it will continue repeating until the transition fires. The transition always respects the
        # blocking behavior of the phase. If the phase ends during a sleepBefore, the transition is
        # aborted.
