  TODO: This Actor does not exist yet. It will be implemented in PERF-2516.
  The State Machine Crud Actor implements a FSM with crud operations. Choices are declared with
  weights, which are converted into probabilities.

  There is an initial state vector, with weight. Each actor instance will probabilistically and
  independently choose it's initial state based on the weights.

  Each state specifies a list of transitions. The next transition is picked probabilistically, based
  on the transition weights. Each transition specifies a delay, thens executes a (possibly empty) set
  of operations, before transitioning to the next state. The state itself may execute its own set of
  operations.

  By default the system will measure the latency to execute each set of operations (per transition
  or per state), and each operation. The latencies associated with each transition and state are
  tracked separately.

  This example workload is a toy example modeling the state of 5 smart phones. The model has four
  states for each phone: On, Off, Sleep, and Error, and transitions between those states. In this
  example, there is monitoring for the smart phones, and the database gets updated based on the
  state of the phones and state changes. The workload (monitoring app) tracks the current phone state in
  one document (update operations). Note that this is separate than the state machinery tracking of
  state. The workload also counts the number of transitions from state On to each of
  the other three states (also update operations).
