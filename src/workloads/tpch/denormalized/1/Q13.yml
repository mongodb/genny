  # At the start of the workload, the mongod will have been restarted and all caches will have been cleared.
  # This is when we start the cold data run. We use 'executionStats' here to cause each command to run its
  # execution plan until no documents remain, which ensures that the query executes in its entirety.
  # This is also configured to log an explain for the query plan to help debug regressions.

  # After the cold run, we need to warm up our caches. This is necessary since running aggregations
  # with explain normally does not result in caching of plans.
