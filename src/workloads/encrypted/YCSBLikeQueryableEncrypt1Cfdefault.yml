Description: |
  Mimics a YCSB workload, with queryable encryption enabled. Performs queries on an encrypted
  field, instead of _id, during the read/update phase. This workload was originally two separate
  files, YCSBLikeQueryableEncrypt1Cfdefault.yml and YCSBLikeQueryableEncrypt1CfdefaultSharded.yml.
  It was merged into a single file when "OnlyRunInInstance: sharded" became an option.
