Description: |
  With queryable encryption enabled, this workload runs alternating CRUD and compact phases,
  where the total number of inserts & updates is increased on every CRUD+Compact cycle in order
  to grow the ECOC collection to a size that is at least twice its pre-compaction size in
  the previous cycle. This is meant to test how long compaction takes relative to ECOC size.
