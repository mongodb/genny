Owner: Cluster Scalability
Description: |
  This test measures the time for a sharded cluster to reshard a collection from one shard to two
  shards then to three shards. It was added August 2023 as part of PM-2322, to demonstrate planned
  resharding performance improvements. Note that the goal of this test is to show the performance
  gain on this setup rather than the performance difference on different kinds of data type.

  The test expects the target cluster is created using ebs snapshot with 1 billion 1KB records and
  has 3 shards, named shard-00, shard-01, shard-02. The collection has 10 indexes including
  _id index, single-key index and compound index. The whole dataset is on 1 shard at the beginning.
  ReshardCollection should use same-key resharding and use shardDistribution parameter to reshard
  into 2 shards then 3 shards. There will be random CRUD operations during resharding but should
  run at a very low rate.

  The workload consists of 3 phases:
    1. Turning off balancer and make the sharded collection exists on only 1 shard.
    2. Running read and write operations on the collection while it is being resharded to 2 shards.
    3. Running read and write operations on the collection while it is being resharded to 3 shards.

  All documents are generated through genny' data loader where the integer and length of short
  string fields are randomly generated. The fields are designed like to form different combinations
  of indexes. The goal of having 10 indexes is to test resharding performance with indexes and the
  number 10 comes from design, which is arbitrary from testing perspective.

  The inserted documents have the following form:

      {
        _id: integer(default _id index),
        shardKey: integer(for the shard key),
        counter: integer(used for counting updates),
        num1: integer(random generated between [1, 1000000000]),
        num2: integer(random generated between [1, 1000000000]),
        str1: string(length <= 20),
        str2: string(length <= 20),
        padding: string(random string of bytes ...)
      }

  The indexes are:
      [
        {_id: 1},
        {shardKey: 1},
        {counter: 1},
        {num1: 1},
        {num2: 1},
        {str1: 1},
        {str2: 1},
        {shardKey: 1, counter:1},
        {str1: 1, num1: 1},
        {num2:1, str2: 1}
      ]

  # The CRUD operations here are to test that resharding won't fail with CRUD operations. We keep
