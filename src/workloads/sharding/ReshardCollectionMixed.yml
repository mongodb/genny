SchemaVersion: 2018-07-01
Owner: "@mongodb/sharding"
Description: |
  Runs the reshardCollection command while read and write operations are active on the collection
  being resharded.

  The workload consists of 5 phases:
    1. Creating an empty sharded collection distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating the sharded collection with data.
    3. Running read and write operations on the collection before it is resharded.
    4. Running read and write operations on the collection while it is being resharded.
    5. Running read and write operations on the collection after it has been resharded.

  The inserted documents have the following form:

      {_id: 10, oldKey: 20, newKey: 30, counter: 0, padding: 'random string of bytes ...'}

  The collection is initially sharded on {oldKey: 'hashed'} and then resharded on {newKey: 1}.
