Owner: Product Performance
Description: |
  Runs a multi-threaded, read-only workload comprising of `findOne` commands that all target the
  same document. The workload inserts a single document and then spawns multiple worker threads to
  retrieve it. The primary objective of this benchmark is to produce stable results that would help
  with identifying regressions introduced by individual commits, and not necessarily measuring the
  end-to-end database performance. Therefore, look for the average throughput and latency of running
  `findOne` commands reported by this benchmark.
