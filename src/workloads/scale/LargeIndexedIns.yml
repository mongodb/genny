Description: |
  This workload sends bursts of finds that use large $ins. The workload
  causes high CPU load as the server becomes bottlenecked on tcmalloc
  spinlocks during the find operations.

  Improvements or regressions in this aspect of the allocator should
  be measurable by the average CPU usage during this test as well as
  the latency of the find operations.

  In this workload, large arrays of random strings are generated to use
  for the $in queries.  To avoid a CPU bottleneck on the workload client,
  it uses a ^Once generator to generate the arrays once during initialization.
