Owner: Replication
Description: |
  This workload loads a large number of small documents into a single collection, and then does a
  small multi-update which touches all of them.  It is intended to measure the impact of the load of
  replication of many oplog entries on the primary.  Number of documents should be significantly
  greater than the maximum replication batch size of 5K (50K is a good minimum).
  We will run this against standalone nodes and single-node replica sets as well as 3-node replica
  sets to determine if any performance changes are due to replication overhead changes (if only
  3-node replica sets are affected) or some other reason.
