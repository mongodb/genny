Description: |
  Used to test performance of the router under memory pressure caused by accumulating
  many heavy cursors. The workload is expected to fail due to host(s) being unreachable as a
  result of mongos running out of memory.

  To achieve this, many threads are spawned to run an unfiltered find on a collection.
  The number and size of documents in that collection are tuned such, that the mongos is able
  to exhaust cursors on shards when pre-filling its buffers [<16MB per shard]. As a result,
  memory pressure on the shards remains low, while it's kept large on the mongos.

Keywords:
  - scale
  - memory stress
  - cursor storm
  - mongos
  - fail
  - oom
  - out of memory
