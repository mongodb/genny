SchemaVersion: 2018-07-01
Owner: Storage Execution
Description: |
  This workload consists of a situation where the server is being contacted by 10k different
  clients to simulate an extreme case of overload in the server. Both reads and writes happen
  at the same time in balanced fashion. Find operations are limited to return 10 documents to
  avoid slow decline in performance as more documents are inserted

  The metrics to monitor are:
    * ErrorsTotal / ErrorRate: The total number of errors and rate of errors encountered by the workload. Networking
      errors are not unexpected in general and they should be recoverable. This work load strives to provide a test to
      allow us to measure the scale of networking errors in a stressful test and prove if the networking becomes more
      stable (with lower total errors and a lower error rate).
    * The Operation latency (more specifically the Latency90thPercentile to Latency99thPercentile metrics)
    * The Operation Throughput
    * "ss connections active": the number of connections.

Keywords:
- scale
- insertMany
- find
