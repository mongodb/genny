Owner: "@mongodb/query"
Description: |
  The workload inserts a single large document, and tests concurrently updating the same document
  with many threads. This is intended to test the behavior of the server under heave memory pressure
  caused by update operations with a high rate of write conflicts. The update operation is on an
  integer field, the command itself is relatively small, so most of the memory pressure should come
  from the query subsystem.
