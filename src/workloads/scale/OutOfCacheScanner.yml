Owner: Storage Execution
Description: |
  A workload which creates 2 databases a "cold" database which is scanned periodically and a "hot"
  database which is read continuously throughout the workload. The intention is that the hot
  database is large enough that it fills WiredTiger's cache and the WiredTiger cache takes up most
  of the system memory so the operating system cache is also not big enough for the cold database.
  Thus the cold data must be read directly from disk. The read latency by the RandomSampler is
  recorded at all times.
