Description: |
  This workload tests the impact of background TTL deletions in a heavily modified collection with
  extreme ticket contention. This test does not quiesce between phases as we want the TTL deleter
  to be constantly running.
Keywords:
- ttl
- stress
- indexes
- insertMany
- CrudActor
