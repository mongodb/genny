Owner: Product Performance
Description: |
  This workload tests the performance of the bulkWrite API, and compares it to normal writes.
  It is modeled as a collection of sensor data. It would be common for this use case to do batching using, e.g., AWS SQS.
  The thread levels for the many connections scenario are tuned for maximum throughput.

  It tests the following scenarios:
  - BulkWrite API, ~30GB data in the db, single connection, no index
  - BulkWrite API, ~30GB data in the db, single connection, with index

  - BulkWrite API, ~30GB data in the db, many connections, no index
  - BulkWrite API, ~30GB data in the db, many connections, with index

  - normal writes, ~30GB data in the db, many connections, no index
  - normal writes, ~30GB data in the db, many connections, with index

  - BulkWrite Upserts, ~30GB data in the db, many connections, with index
