Owner: mongodb/server-replication"
Description: |
  Adds CRUD operations to be replayed during startup recovery for the heavy phase.
  To know more about the test phases please refer to 'src/workloads/replication/startup/README.md'.

  Expected behavior:
  --------------
  We expect after restarting mongod after running this workload to have alot of CRUD ops to be
  applied during startup recovery:

  Sample logs:
  ```
