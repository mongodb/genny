Description: |
  Workload to Benchmark the effect of LongLivedTransactions on a Mixed workload.
  The intent here is to test multiple transactions contained within a singular transaction (long lived).
  The transactions are setup such that they cover a mixed set of operations (insert, query, update, remove).
  The operations are also divided in the length of their run (short, medium, long) and whether they contain scans or not.
  The workload has the following configuration:
  ~7GB dataset
  6,000,000 documnets in total
  Warm up phase, then operation phase followed by a quiesce phase
  Naming Conventions:
  Duration.Load_level.Operation.Type_of_test
  Operation:     Insert|Query|Update|Remove|Mixed
  Duration:      Short|Medium|Long
  Type of test:  Baseline|Benchmark
  Baseline without scans, benchmark with scans
