Linting YAML files

If you update/add any YAML files under the workload and/or resmoke directory or
the evergreen file, please lint them first: src/lamplib/src/genny/tasks/

cd <genny_repo_root>        # replace `<genny_repo_root>` with the actual directory
./run-genny -v lint-yaml --format

### Merging and Linting

We currently have a manual linting stage required if you're
adding/modifying a workload YAML document. Evergreen will verify that
this has been run.

```bash
./run-genny generate-docs
```

Once (1) your PR is approved by a CODEOWNER and (2) all your CI tests
pass, you can initiate a merge by clicking "Add to merge queue".
This kicks your PR into the [Github Merge Queue]. Github will
automatically squash-merge your commit after checking that Evergreen's
CI tasks have returned a successful status.
