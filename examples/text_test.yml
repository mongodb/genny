# This workload is based off of SERVER-21690 and uses its data set. You must download the data file in order to run this test.
#
# Download https://s3.amazonaws.com/cap-david-daly/books.json.gz into the examples directory (same directory as this file), and unzip it.
# wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/cap-david-daly/books.json.gz
# gunzip books.json.gz

# There are three parts to this test. The first two run by
# default. Each can be run indepently, although the last two assume
# the data has already been loaded. To run any part my itself add that
# target to the end of the mwg commandline
# (e.g., mwg text_test.yml load_data)

# 1. load_data. This uses the load_file node to read in books.json and
# load it into the database. It also creates the text index on the
# collection.

# 2. agg_load: This is the aggregation workload described in the SERVER ticket.

# 3. query_load: This runs fund commands against the book corpus,
# using a small test of search terms. Can easily be extended to use a
# large list of search terms.
