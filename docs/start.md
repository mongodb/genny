These are the docs for Genny specifically! For an overall view of MongoDB's performance testing infrastructure, please
look at the [Performance Tooling Docs](https://github.com/10gen/performance-tooling-docs).

If you have any questions, please reach out to the DEVPROD team in our dedicated slack channel: `#ask-devprod-performance`.
If you feel like these docs can be improved in any way, feel free to open a PR and assign someone from DEVPROD. No ticket necessary.
