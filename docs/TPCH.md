# TPCH Workload Documentation

The [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/) is a decision support benchmark. It consists of a suite of business oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.

We support several setups of the TPC-H benchmark by varying the scale and schema type.
