to grow the ECOC collection to a size that is at least twice its pre-compaction size in
the previous cycle. This is meant to test how long compaction takes relative to ECOC size.

### Description
Runs mass deletions over a set of 1KB documents, then mass deletions over a set of larger, 10MB documents.
For each size of document:
  . Populates a collection with documents of size n-bytes, then performs a mass deletion on the collection.
  . Repopulates a collection with documents of size n-bytes, then performs a mass deletion while
    performing concurrent writes on another collection.
Allows for comparing the performance of the DELETE_STAGE vs the BATCHED_DELETE_STAGE, primarily in
terms of deletion throughput, and w:majority latencies of the concurrent writes. Also, allows for
comparisons in performance when mass deletions are performed over different sized documents.
The mass deletion namespace is test.Collection0
The concurrent writes namespace is test.concurrentWritesColl

### Description
Phase defintions for the MixedWorkloadsGenny, which is a port of the mixed_workloads in the
workloads repo. https://github.com/10gen/workloads/blob/master/workloads/mix.js. It runs 4 sets of
operations, each with dedicated actors/threads. The 4 operations are insertOne, findOne,
updateOne, and deleteOne. Since each type of operation runs in a dedicated thread it enables
interesting behavior, such as reads getting faster because of a write regression, or reads being
starved by writes. The origin of the test was as a reproduction for BF-2385 in which reads were
starved out by writes.

### Owner 
Cluster Scalability 


### Support Channel
[#server-sharding](https://mongodb.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C8PK5KZ5H)


### Description
This workload template does the following (with
PauseMigrationsDuringMultiUpdates disabled):
  * Create an unsharded collection.
  * Insert 50k documents of around 20kB each using the monotonic loader.
  * Run updateMany as many times as possible in two 5 minute phases, where
    updateMany will update all of the 50k documents per command in the first
    phase and only a single document per command in the second phase.

Two parameters are accepted to alter the behavior of this workload:
  * ShardCollectionPhases: Valid values are [] and [1]. If set to []
    (default), the collection remains unsharded. If set to [1], the collection
    will be sharded with a hashed shard key on _id.
  * PauseMigrationsPhases: Valid values are [] and [1]. If set to []
    (default), PauseMigrationsDuringMultiUpdates will be disabled. If set to
    [1], PauseMigrationsDuringMultiUpdates will be enabled.

The intent of this workload is to measure the throughput of updateMany, so the
OperationThroughput and OperationsTotal metrics for DocumentUpdater.UpdateAll
and DocumentUpdater.UpdateOne should be used to evaluate performance when
updating all documents per command and a single document per command
respectively.
